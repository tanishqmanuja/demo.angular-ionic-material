# Angular Ionic-Material

This project showcases the ability to create a native looking material design 3 android application using the following stack:
- [Angular](https://angular.dev/) as Frontend Framework
- [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) as UI Framework
- [Material Web](https://github.com/material-components/material-web) for Material Design Components
- [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) for Native Bindings

#### Why not angular material instead of material web?
Because of this - https://github.com/angular/components/issues/29104
